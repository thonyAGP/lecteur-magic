}
```

**Summary**: The generated code has good structure (35% coverage) with proper separation of concerns, but **critically lacks business rules** because the specification appears incomplete. The main gaps are:

1. **Missing table mappings** for 3 of 4 referenced tables
2. **No validation logic** for the boolean checks mentioned in the spec
3. **Currency formatting** incomplete despite having types defined
4. **No integration points** with calling programs (IDE 121, 298)
5. **Store implementation cut off** mid-line

The code is production-ready **only for UI rendering**, but needs backend integration and validation logic to match the spec's description of a "read-only audit module with session validation".
