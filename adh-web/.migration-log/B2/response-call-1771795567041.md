```

**Summary**: The implementation provides a functional UI skeleton (75% coverage) but lacks the critical backend integration and business rules validation. The contract file is empty, making it impossible to verify if the business logic from the Magic program is correctly implemented. All API calls are mocked, and there's no mapping between the UI types and the 4 database tables referenced in the spec (histo_sessions_caisse, histo_sessions_caisse_detail, histo_sessions_caisse_devise, devise_in). The store architecture is sound, but needs real data access implementation and proper integration with the backend API endpoints.
