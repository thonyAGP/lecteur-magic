    "CRITICAL: Implement access rights logic in store to filter displayed columns (amounts, detailed balances) based on operator profile permissions",
    "HIGH: Add integration with ADH IDE 43 (account resolution service) to enrich operation rows with adherent names instead of just IDs",
    "HIGH: Add proper handling of 'isEndOfHistory' flag in OperationsGridPanel to indicate when no more data is available",
    "MEDIUM: Add chronological sorting validation - spec requires chronological order to 'reconstitute event timeline', currently only date-based sorting",
    "MEDIUM: SessionDetailsPanel should display more session metadata (opened/closed times, operator name) matching the spec's audit/control purpose",
    "MEDIUM: Add visual indicators for session status (OUVERTE/FERMEE) in SessionsListPanel with color coding",
    "LOW: SessionSummaryPanel could display breakdown by operation type (ventes, encaissements, remboursements) as spec mentions these transaction types",
    "LOW: Add export functionality validation - CSV export exists but doesn't include all transaction details mentioned in spec",
    "LOW: Consider adding time-based filtering (not just date) since spec emphasizes chronological tracking with time precision",
    "ARCHITECTURAL: Missing entity types for 'operations' table (Table 249) - only SessionHistoryItem type exists, should have OperationItem type for transaction-level detail",
    "TESTING: No error handling tests visible for failed API calls to session details/currencies endpoints",
    "TESTING: No tests for filters validation (startDate before endDate, invalid date formats, etc.)",
    "UI/UX: Missing loading states in SessionsListPanel when fetching initial data",
    "UI/UX: Missing empty state component when no sessions match filters",
    "UI/UX: Consider adding pagination for large session lists (spec shows 10 mock items but production could have hundreds)",
    "ACCESSIBILITY: Table headers in SessionsListPanel need proper ARIA labels for screen readers",
    "PERFORMANCE: SessionsListPanel re-renders entire list on selection - consider virtualization for large datasets",
    "CODE QUALITY: FiltersPanel has duplicate STATUS_OPTIONS constant - should import from shared constants file"

```

**Summary:**

✅ **Strong implementation (85% coverage):**
- Core data flow (store → API → UI) is well structured
- Mock data generation matches spec entities (sessions, details, currencies)
- Filter panel with date range, status, operator ID
- Multi-panel layout (filters, list, details, summary)
- CSV export functionality
- Proper TypeScript types for all entities

❌ **Critical gaps:**
1. **Access rights filtering** - Spec explicitly states "Le programme applique les droits d'accès pour déterminer quelles colonnes afficher (soldes, montants détaillés, etc.) selon le profil de l'opérateur" - this is NOT implemented
2. **ADH IDE 43 integration** - Spec says program calls IDE 43 to resolve account IDs to names ("pour résoudre les identifiants de compte en noms d'adhérents") - missing entirely
3. **Transaction-level detail** - Spec describes showing individual operations (ventes, encaissements, remboursements) but UI only shows session-level aggregates

**Recommended priority fixes:**
1. Add `useAuthStore` integration to check operator permissions and conditionally render columns
2. Create `adhApi.resolveAccountName(accountId)` endpoint and call it when rendering operations
3. Extend `SessionDetail` type to include array of `OperationItem[]` with transaction-level data
